        <p>Hello, my name is David Gaylord and Iâ€™m a creative and hardworking UX/UI Designer that strives to create and improve the user experience and interaction with applications and websites. I have a background in Graphic and Web Design which allows me to create visually pleasing designs as well as the ability to edit code. My experience in these fields have taught me how to prioritize and manage timelines on multiple projects that have strict deadlines. The marketing team I currently work in was at one point as large as 15 people, and is now down to 5. Throughout this change in size, I have worked well on the team with other designers and project managers, as well as independently. I have been described as focused and reliable by multiple employers and am looking forward to using my knowledge and experience to add value to my future employer as a UX/UI Designer.</p>
